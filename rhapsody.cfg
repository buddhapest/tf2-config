// Rhapsody's Performance Config - 9/15/15 #2
// Launch options stated here. Copy these into TF2's launch options, and remove -dxlevel 90 after the first launch,
// or else your graphics settings will keep reverting if you modify them.
// Fullscreen: -dxlevel 90 -full -w WIDTH -h HEIGHT -console -novid -useforcedmparms -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd
// Windowed:   -dxlevel 90 -sw -w WIDTH -h HEIGHT -console -noborder -novid -useforcedmparms -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd
// Don't use -dxlevel 95 with this config. I've attempted to, but for some reason, whenever you exit the graphics options with -dxlevel 95 enabled, it defaults back to -dxlevel 90 or even -dxlevel 80.
// I'll look into this in the future.

// >> PLEASE NOTE
// All of these settings, besides the Graphical and Miscellaneous section, can be changed in-game with commands.
// These changes will persist through restarts, since allof them are commented in this autoexec. Only edit/uncomment
// commented lines if you don't intend to use the console commands, since it's really not needed otherwise.

// Changelog (newest to oldest)
//
// 9/15/14 #2
// - Added some convars from m0re's config due to reported FPS gain. Experimental.
// - Enabled some convars that should've been enabled, thanks Comanglia
//
// 9/15/14
// - Added more Extras
// - Added a convar to Shadows
// - Commented some useless convars/convars that don't have any purpose in TF2
//
// 9/14/14 #3
// - Public release!
// - Added new Extras section for patient users that make it to the end of the wizard.
//
// 9/14/14 #2
// - Experimental change that simplifies the config a ton; normal users won't have to modify the autoexec at all unless
//   there's something they really want to change, since a lot of the non-core changes have in-game commands now. Additionally,
//   such changes are now written to the config.cfg, so they now persist through restarts.
// - Added 'setup' command.
// - Removed the silence script since it seems to not work. I'll be looking for a replacement.
//
// 9/14/14
// - Experimented some more with some convars and discovered that studio_queue_mode can indeed cause crashes if not set to 1. 
//   Commented that line, but if you don't crash when it's set to 0, then use it!
// - Started adding console commands that allow you to change some settings on the fly, such as connection settings,
//   shadow settings, etc. They're not done yet, since I'm tired right now and don't feel like finishing it yet. If
//   you're using this config at this point, then just keep checking back for updates; I'll probably finish it in a bit.
// - Marked hardware model convars as defunct.
//
// 9/13/14
// - Initial (private) release.
